### Entry level
<!-- (consider floating layout) -->
<!--
TODO:
- once we have a lot of these badges defined, we can also shuffle them back and forth
- Have an image icon which shows what section it's from (like in editor icons)
- combine some of the smaller badges so it adds up to the correct amount of hours

TODO:  
- [ ] Combine some of these smaller ones
- [ ] Should in-depth floats be more of an advnaced topic?
- [ ] Q: Does it make more sense to have intro for all these here, and then more in-depth in later levels?
- [ ] Add more for JS, Devtools, MVC, etc...
