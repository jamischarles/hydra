Hydra is a free guide to help web developers level up. We link to free and (some) paid resources.

How is this different from sites that teach you coding skills ([Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), etc)?
---
These sites are great. We love them. However, none have a complete set of skills yet, as most are targeted at beginners.

We help you level up regardless of current level. Beginner? Intermediate? Advanced JS Dev already? How do you level up? This guide helps.
Most of the content here will be from existing articles & tutorials.


So how does it work?
---
**As a team**:
Managers: Give your team 10% of their time to level up. Want them to start using TDD? Ask them to complete the TDD badge. This will
bridge the skill gap to help them actually start writing code the TDD way. If a badge doesn't exist, submit a PR. Buy them lunch
if they complete a badge (or some other reward).

**As an individual**:
Go through the exercises. Read the articles. Find somebody smarter than you who can sign you off. If you can't, use the honor system.
In the end, it's all about improving your skills and marketability.

Earning badges:
---
Somebody who has earned the badge already generally signs off somebody trying to earn that badge.

You assign badges based on the knowledge or competency they have. If they have prior work that shows competency, they can show that
to receive their badge.

Earn a badge in CSS Floats? You should now be competent in using them. Team-members, friends and family now know who to turn to.

- [HTML](skills/html.md)
- [CSS](skills/css.md)
- JS

- Templating (server or client)
- Client-side MVC
- Soft skills? (time managmetn, conflict resolution?)

Inspiration
----------------
Idea comes from the hard work in the [skill-building-program](https://github.com/fs-webdev/skill-building-program) at FamilySearch.
