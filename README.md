Status
---------------
This is in early alpha, and is a VERY rough draft. Everything is subject to change.

Intro
----------------

This is a guide to help you level up in your technical career. It tries to answer this question:

- As a new developer how do I come up to speed and gain skill parity with my team?
- As a mature developer, how do I dive into new areas, and then spread those skills among the team?
How do I level up? How can I dive start into something like TDD or Benchmarking that often has a high
learning curve and frequently has little or no documentation / best practices?

This framework is a vehicle that moves us towards that goal in a scalable way. Have drive but lack direction? This is the steering
wheel for your car.


@TODO: look at the TED talk from Justin Kaufman(?) about most learning occurring in the first few hours)

Contributing
----------------
The smallest piece to contribute is a badge. Save a new badge in the `new_badges_uncategorized` folder. They will be assigned to a skill during the review process.

Use cases
----------------
A skill development program for a team. Assuming a team of front-end engineers the first question you should ask is:
- What skills does it take to be a competent front-end engineer at this company?
- What distinguishes entry level from competent, competent from high performers?

Suggested Job classes
----------------
**Note**: These will be a very strong "suggested", because this will likely vary with each company. This section may be removed entirely.

**Front-end engineer**  
An entry level front-end engineer should have these skills at a basic level.
- [HTML](skills/html.md)
- [CSS](skills/css.md)
- JS
- GIT
- Templating (server or client)
- Client-side MVC
- Soft skills? (time managmetn, conflict resolution?)

- Troubleshooting?
- Debugging


**Architect**  
What skills does it take to be a good architect? Does this depend on the company?
Any universal skills that can be broken down into micro-badges?


**Terminology**
----------------
- **Job Class** (or track). A job (like Front-end Engineer) is made up of skills.
- **Skill**. A skill (like HTML) is made up of badges.
- **Badge**. A badge is a skill broken down into digestible bite sized pieces for easy consumption.

So... A Job is made up of skills, which are made up of badges.

Philosophy
----------------
We try not to be too prescriptive. The idea is that there are lots of little badges.

This is intended to adopted by dev teams and changed to suit their needs. The framework should keep the reusable abstracted.
The parts that can't be reused should be maintained by the dev team.

This is really about deliberate practice (@TODO: link Malcolm Gladwell). Most devs don't deliberately practice their skills.

Inspiration / Source / Origin
----------------
This draws heavily on the thoughts and philosphies of the [skill-building-program](https://github.com/fs-webdev/skill-building-program) that Rob Whiting at
FamilySearch developed. The Front-end teams there have been using it successfully for quite some time now.
